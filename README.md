# AI-Powered-Travel-Itinerary-Generator

This is a Python-based travel itinerary generator that uses APIs for hotel recommendations, attractions, and a Groq-powered AI model to generate a custom travel plan. The project allows users to input their destination, budget, number of people, and trip dates to receive hotel and attraction recommendations, along with a day-by-day itinerary.

## Features
